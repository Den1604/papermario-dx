## Does it support Star Rod?

Yes! Star Rod enables you to visually edit maps and sprites.

To use Star Rod, when prompted to select a directory for your mod, select the `papermario-dx` directory.

## List of changes

- US release only (no JP, PAL, or iQue - none of these are near 100% yet)
- Shiftable builds by default
- `DX_DEBUG_MENU` - Enables a debug menu. Navigate with the D-pad (D-L for back, D-R for open, D-U/D-D for up/down).
- `DX_SKIP_LOGOS` - Skips the logos at the start of the game.
- `DX_SKIP_TITLE` - Skips the title screen and file select, loading the first savefile automatically.
- `DX_FULL_VIEWPORT` - Disables letterboxing of the viewport and resizes HUD elements to accomodate. This is a work in progress: the HUD can be a bit weird and the background is not scaled.
